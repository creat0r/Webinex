Webinar management for MODX Revolution

0.3.0 - beta version, to submit to repository. Added support for emails, affiliates, and registration including an extension of modUser, created transport package.

0.2.0 - this is the preliminary development version of a webinar managment system for MODX Revolution. It includes a Custom Resource Class for Webinars and a Custom Manager Page for managing presenters, companies, affiliates, documents, and videos for your webinars.

I have not created a build package for this yet, so I don't recomment installing it at this point. The code is here mostly for reference.
